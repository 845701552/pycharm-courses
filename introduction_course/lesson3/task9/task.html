There are a lot of useful string methods. You can use the 'lower()' method to get rid of all the capitalization in your strings.
'upper()' method is used to make a string upper cased. To call any string method, type dot after the string (or variable containing string)
and method name after it, e.g. "John".upper(). In PyCharm you can explore all available string methods by using Ctrl+Space after dot.
