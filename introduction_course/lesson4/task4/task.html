Tuples are almost identical to lists. The one main difference between tuples and lists are that tuples cannot be changed.
That is to say you cannot add, change, or delete elements from the tuple.
Tuples are constructed by the comma operator with enclosing parentheses (a, b, c).
A single item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as (d,).
