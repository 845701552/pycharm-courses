Lists are a data structure you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequence under a single variable name.
List can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets e.g. lst = [item1, item2].
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
Like strings, lists can be indexed and sliced (see Lesson 3).

Use list slicing to print [4, 9, 16]
