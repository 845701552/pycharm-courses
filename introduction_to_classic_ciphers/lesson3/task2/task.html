Below is an implementation of encrypt(). Your job is to fill in the missing pieces.
<br/>
<br/>
The implementation takes as parameters the message and the key value.
It pre-treats the text (using a function similar to what you did in Lesson 1) and then looks at each letter in the message, one-by-one,
replacing each letter with a 5-letter string of randomly-chosen characters.

<br/>
<br/>
The script executes the function with 2 test cases.
